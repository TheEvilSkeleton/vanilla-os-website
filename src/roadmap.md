## Terms
* **Stable**: A release that is ready for production use.
* **Closed/Open Beta**: A release that is ready for testing and feedback.
* **Release Candidate**: A release that is proposed for the stable release.

All releases are always available for download on our GitHub page, the main
difference is the level of support and stability.
